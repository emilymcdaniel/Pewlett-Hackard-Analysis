### Deliverable 2
Given the high volume of staff who will likely retire within a short period, it is in Pewlett Hackard's best interest to prepare for this by ensuring junior employees are trained and knowledgable. Numbers were ran for a mentorship program; the Mentorship Eligibility list shows employees born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

## Data Issues
Please note that this data:
 - Does not exclude those who have already left the Pewlett Hackard
 - Does not include input from these employees on whether they intend to exit the organization
 - The Mentorship Eligibility list may be better received if mentors are be determined by experience, time with the company, interest in mentorship, etc rather than age.

Please see below for a visual outline of the data.
